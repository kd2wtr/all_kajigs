This is a repository that aims to collect as many kajigs(exploits) as possible. Specifically targeting those that are aimed at 
device unenrollment. This repository is not in any way affiliated with the Titanium network discord server or any other platform
that supports this type of software. if you have a tested and working exploit for enrolled devices, submit a pull request with SCREENSHOTS/PICTURES. As well as a detailed step-by-step explanation.
If you already have that (Eg. Skiovox)  in a PDF or other type of document, feel free to upload that document rather than rewrite the entire thing. 
If something fails to work, please put it in an issue. If you followed the directions correctly, (and your device was even supported in the first place) then we will consider moving said exploit into
the archived folder. The Archived folder is designed for nonfunctional, but still worth referencing projects. It is possible, sometimes to use them after downgrading your chromos.

Oh and, hey IT admins that are snooping, People shouldn't be using this on their school devices.
